RSS Proposition - Utopian-io

#### Repository

https://github.com/steemit/condenser


#### Components

This is a suggestion to implement the RSS feed functionality in Steemit and in the other general interfaces (e.g. busy.org, steempeak)


#### Proposal Description

Offering an RSS feed URL(with excerpt) for
* personal blogs
* tags
* hot, new and trending (if possible for different tags)
would be a valuable asset, both for individual users as for the Steemit platform. 

RSS feeds allow users to promote their content beyond the barriers of the Steemit platform. RSS feeds are updated automatically and will always display the most recent content.



#### Mock-ups / Examples



#### Benefits

RSS feeds can be used in many ways. They can not only drive more traffic to a user's post, they will also attract more users to the Steem blockchain, and will create  a huge number of back-links to the site.

RSS feeds have many possibilities:

* RSS feed URLs can be submitted to the search engines and RSS feed directories,  which will improve both the ranking of posts and of the Steemit site itself.

* RSS feeds can be used to build aggregation pages which display different blocks of Steemit content all around the web.

* Users will be able to offer RSS feed (or even newsletter) subscriptions so they can build a reoccurring audience.

* Widgets with the RSS feed of choice can be set up on external sites. This way, links to Steemit can be distributed and will bring in more potential new users.

* People can set up auto-blogs using multiple RSS feeds, again generating more back-links and more potential new signups

* Links to Steemit posts can be shared on other social media platforms and bookmarking sites on complete autopilot through services like IFTTT, which is again a good promotional tactic to attract new users to the platform

* Users can follow their favorite authors or tags in one of the many feed-reader services

* Search indexes will detect content faster especially when the RSS feeds are pinged regularly.

There are many more advantages to the use of an RSS feed, but I think I covered the most important ones.
